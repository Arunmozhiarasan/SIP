MOOD IDENTIFICATION FROM FACIAL EXPRESSION USING IMAGE PROCESSING

The project aims to develop a system that can detect a person's mood by analysing their facial expressions from their images captured. Facial expression is a vital mode of communication of human emotions that has been studied throughout the world in many fields. This system could find many applications like attendance recording system school/ college/workplace, user authentication using face image, hospitals where the pain of patients can be recognised by the facial expression and so on.  Facial expression recognition is one of the most effective naturalizing and instant means for people to convey their feelings and intentions. To achieve this, various image processing techniques are implemented. These techniques involve feature extraction from facial landmarks, which helps in identifying key facial expressions indicative of different moods. This project is implemented such that it can be tested only for happy, sad and uncertain mood.
